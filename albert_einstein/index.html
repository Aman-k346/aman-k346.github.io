      Albert Einstein; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955 was a German-born
      theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and
      most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for
      developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
      contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.
      Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern
      physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
      relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His
      work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He
      received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical
      physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
      effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His
      intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming
      synonymous with "genius".
